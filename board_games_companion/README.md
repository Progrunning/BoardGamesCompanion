## Running Hive Generator

The command to generate hive files is:
`flutter packages pub run build_runner build -v`

Sometimes when the generation fails you might need to add this parameter `--delete-conflicting-outputs` in order to delete conflicting files

## App Mockups

The Google Play Store and Apple Store mockups are locate in the `assets/mockups/` directory. The file `*.mockup` file contains all the screenshots and different devices mockups.

Go to https://studio.app-mockup.com/ and `Load` the `*.mockup` file in order to update mockups. Once finished with editing `Save` the new `*.mockup` file and update it in the repo.
